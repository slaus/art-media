                        <p>This year, as in the past, we want to demonstrate the expertise and value of our content and
                            continue to provide users with high-performing web pages. These strategies have always been
                            important throughout the history of SEO, but Google strictly evaluates signals and
                            determines
                            which content truly meets these standards.</p>
                        <h4>Let's take a closer look at what we mean and how you can meet these standards.</h4>
                    </div>
                    <div data-aos="fade-up">
                        <h3>1. Personal experience on the topic (new letter "E" in EEAT)</h3>
                        <p>As of December 2022, the popular Google EAT (Expertise, Authority, Trust) abbreviation has
                            received an additional E: Experience. Google will now take into account the experience of
                            the
                            author or creator when assessing the quality of content.
                            So what does "experience" really mean? Google wants to see that the author of the content
                            has
                            direct, real-world experience with the topic under discussion.
                            For example, as the founder of an SEO agency, I have real-world experience, and I can speak
                            authoritatively about SEO trends that will emerge in 2023. But I'm not good at writing about
                            diseases because I'm not a medical professional and have no experience in the healthcare
                            sector,
                            and this reduces the quality of the content
                            This means that more websites need to pay closer attention not only to who their content
                            creators are, but also to the topics they focus on.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Which brings me to the next two trends.</h4>
                    </div>
                    <div data-aos="fade-up">
                        <h3>2. Content focused on audience, not traffic</h3>
                        <p>One reason for this increased focus on experience is that SEO content creation is
                            proliferating.
                            But if a website that sells financial software publishes a blog post with food recipes,
                            Google's
                            search crawlers find it suspicious. Does this content really benefit the target audience of
                            financial software users? Does the site help rank for certain high-volume keywords?
                        </p>
                        <p>You already know the answer. The reality is that companies whose content strategy is simply
                            to
                            generate search traffic with little or no regard for what users actually want are unlikely
                            to
                            succeed in 2023. Sticking to your overall theme and industry areas is essential to creating
                            content worthy of ranking.</p>
                        <p>Not sure what topics to explore in your content? A content planning tool can help you
                            identify
                            relevant industry topics that your target audience is looking for. Enter a keyword and the
                            tool
                            will show you a variety of semantically related keywords that users enter into the search
                            bar.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div data-aos="fade-up">
                        <h3>3. Increased emphasis on author authority</h3>
                        <p>Another reason why Google pays special attention to experience is to increase the ranking of
                            automatically generated content in search results. Google wants to make sure that the
                            content
                            that will rank in 2023 is created by real people with real audiences in mind.</p>
                        <p>So, what can you do to boost the expertise and authority of your writers this year? First of
                            all,
                            make sure that the people who create your content are truly experts. Then enhance their
                            experience in the following ways:</p>
                        <p>Include author bios to better and more fully convey your content creator's knowledge and
                            areas of
                            expertise.</p>
                        <p>Create author pages where you post links to all articles on your site written by the author.
                            Link your authors' social media accounts so that Google can more easily understand from
                            social
                            signals that they are real people and genuine experts.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div data-aos="fade-up">
                        <h3>4. Useful content</h3>
                        <p>Google's August 2022 Useful Content Update is another important algorithm update that will
                            affect
                            the way we create content in 2023.</p>
                        <p>Throughout its history, Google has always prioritized providing users with high-quality
                            content.
                            But its new emphasis on "usefulness" suggests that users should feel "satisfied" with the
                            content they click on in search results.</p>
                        <p>However, user satisfaction is not easy to measure or quantify. So what does Google mean by
                            useful?</p>
                        <h5>Content that:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Created for people, not search engines.</li>
                            <li>Suitable for the target audience.</li>
                            <li>Relates to the main topic or subject area of the website.</li>
                            <li>Created by authoritative, experienced creators.</li>
                            <li>Reflects the depth of knowledge on the topic.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Creating useful content is easier said than done. So how can you make your content more
                            useful?
                        </p>
                        <p>First, focus on quality, not quantity. While your 2023 content calendar will likely have a
                            lot of
                            targeted keywords, pumping out a lot of content that is not useful and does not require
                            expertise is unlikely to yield high results in 2023.</p>
                        <p>Second, expand your keyword research to include information beyond just search volume.</p>
                        <h5>Consider the following:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What types of content are ranking for specific queries?</li>
                            <li>How long is the content?</li>
                            <li>What questions does it answer?</li>
                            <li>What other subtopics or related issues does it explore?</li>
                            <li>What are the links on the page?</li>
                            <li>Who is the author?</li>
                            <li>What is their background?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Keyword research and content research can provide all kinds of information about these
                            quality
                            metrics, so make sure you're not just looking at potential organic traffic.
                        </p>

                    <div data-aos="fade-up">
                        <h3>5. AI content and content writing software</h3>
                        <p>Despite all the updates in 2022 aimed at combating auto-generated content, the use of AI
                            content
                            is likely to increase in 2023.</p>
                        <p>The number of marketing apps that now integrate SEO and AI is only growing. And this is not
                            surprising because these integrations can save time! Most content marketers have used some
                            version of an AI content generator over the past year.</p>
                        <p>But with all the latest Google updates, is it still safe to use content writing software?
                            Absolutely! Creating auto-generated drafts is off-limits, but marketers can still use these
                            tools to speed up their content workflows and create original, high-quality content.

                        <p>Just like artificial intelligence for content, more and more SEO tasks will be automated in
                            2023
                            as digital marketers continue to leverage the power of enterprise SEO software platforms and
                            tools.</p>
                        <h5>For example:</h5>
                        <p>Keyword research tools can automate tasks that required a lot of manual spreadsheet work.</p>
                        <p>Website audit and monitoring platforms such as SearchAtlas and Content King can automatically
                            detect changes and technical issues on websites.</p>
                        <p>Website evaluators can help those who are less knowledgeable about SEO identify the necessary
                            optimizations and prioritize them accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The increase in these DIY SEO tools will also allow businesses and agencies to take care of
                            tactics more effectively and focus more on strategy.

                        <p>Get ready to change the way you think about CTR and rankings.
                            With infinite scrolling now available on both mobile and desktop, Google has made it much
                            easier
                            for users to scroll through multiple pages of search results to find the content they're
                            looking
                            for.</p>
                        <p>For many years, the relationship between ranking position and CTR remained fairly stable,
                            with
                            the first three results accounting for the majority of clicks.</p>
                        <p>But in 2023, click-through rates are likely to suffer as users find it easier to navigate
                            through
                            multiple pages of search results.</p>
                        <p>As for those dreaded zero-click searches we've heard about over the years, a recent study by
                            SEMrush found that only about 25.8% of searches resulted in zero clicks. As Google continues
                            to
                            add more featured snippets and search features such as "People are also asking", CTR may not
                            suffer as much from the lack of clicks as anticipated.</p>
                        <p>Although going to the first page is still ideal, being on the second or third page will have
                            more
                            advantages than before due to the endless scrolling. Therefore, make sure you optimize those
                            page titles and meta descriptions and use features like schema markup to make your content
                            more
                            attractive and clickable in the SERPs.

                        <p>As Google continues to reward long, informative content, pages with little content, such as
                            product pages, can benefit in 2023 by providing more useful information on the page.</p>
                        <p>Frequently asked questions and customer reviews are all ways to add additional content to a
                            product page. While adding keywords to the product description is helpful, think about other
                            questions that users may want answered about the product before purchasing.</p>

                            competitor analysis will become even easier and more effective with the help of SEO tools.
                        </p>
                        <p>As Google pays more attention to industry expertise and website topic areas, studying the

                        <h3>10. Less scanning frequency</h3>
                        <p>Google recently set itself big climate goals, including going carbon-free by 2023. To achieve
                            this goal, Google is considering reducing the frequency of web page crawling.</p>
                        <p>Reducing crawling helps conserve computing resources and is one of the easiest changes Google
                            can
                            make in line with its sustainability initiatives.</p>
                        <p>However, reducing crawl speeds is more likely to affect refresh crawls rather than crawls
                            that
                            detect new content. This means that it may take longer for Google to take into account the
                            new
                            changes we make to our websites.</p>
                        <p>That's why optimizing your content from the start with all the on-page elements you'll need
                            to
                            rank is the best strategic choice in 2023.

                        <h3>11. SEO optimization of images</h3>
                        <p>Images are often neglected on websites, but they have always played a role in boosting
                            rankings
                            in image searches.</p>
                        <p>They can also provide an opportunity to include additional keywords and semantically related
                            terms in our content through placeholder text.</p>
                        <p>Google likes to see placeholder text and schema markup that helps their search crawlers
                            better
                            understand the content of images. Google also likes it when webmasters make their content
                            more
                            accessible to all users. Alternative text also helps to make the web better for people with
                            visual impairments or people with limited internet bandwidth or connection issues.

                        <p>Starting with the 2021 page update, Google is paying more attention to high-performing and
                            fast-loading websites in its ranking algorithm.</p>
                        <p>While the page UI update may seem like old news, Google isn't done rolling out the update
                            until
                            March 2022 and will continue to refine the signals it uses to determine if a page is truly a
                            high-performing user experience.</p>
                        <p>In 2023, Page Speed Insights and Core Web Vitals will continue to be important tools for
                            monitoring and evaluating website speed and performance.</p>
                        <p>Along with content quality, prioritizing page speed improvements will definitely pay off for
                            companies by increasing keyword rankings for all web pages on their domain.
